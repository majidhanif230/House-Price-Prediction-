# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project by Majid Hanif! This project is designed to predict house prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various features such as average income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and population in the area, we can build a model that estimates the price of a house.

## Introduction

The housing market is a vital aspect of the economy, and accurately predicting house prices can benefit various stakeholders, including homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors. This project leverages a dataset containing 5000 rows and includes parameters such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and area population to train a machine learning model for predicting house prices.
