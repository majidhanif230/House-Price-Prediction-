# House Price Prediction

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project, developed by Majid Hanif. This project employs machine learning techniques to predict house prices based on various features such as average income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and population in the area.

## Introduction

The housing market is a critical aspect of the economy, and accurately predicting house prices can benefit stakeholders such as homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors. This project utilizes a dataset consisting of 5000 rows, encompassing several parameters, to train a machine learning model for predicting house prices.

## Parameters

### 5000 houses data

### Average Income
- Description: Average income of residents in the area.

### House Age
- Description: Average age of houses in the area.

### Number of Rooms
- Description: Average number of rooms in houses in the area.

### Number of Bedrooms
- Description: Average number of bedrooms in houses in the area.

### Area Population
- Description: Population of the area.

## Accuracy
89%
